                <hr />
                <p>I'm a passionate computer programmer currently pursuing my master's in software development. My journey began as a child care professional, where I cultivated a love for nurturing young minds.</p>
                <p>Driven by my desire to make a positive impact, I transitioned into software engineering, combining my expertise in education with my technical skills to create innovative solutions for children's education and well-being.</p>
                <p>Outside of work, I enjoy cooking for friends, exploring historical sites, and indulging in the quiet of libraries surrounded by books.</p>
